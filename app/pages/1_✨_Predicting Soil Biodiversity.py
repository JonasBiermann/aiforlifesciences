    st.write("To unravel the intricate connections between features and biodiversity, we employed the SHAP algorithm. SHAP values offer insightful explanations for individual predictions, shedding light on the contribution of each feature to the model's output. This interpretability is crucial for understanding the model's decision-making process.")

    st.write("We rigorously validated and fine-tuned the model to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, optimizing hyperparameters, and employing techniques to mitigate overfitting.")

    st.subheader("Results and Implications")
    st.write("The resulting model provides a reliable tool for predicting soil biodiversity, offering valuable insights for land management and conservation efforts. By understanding the influence of pH, nutrient levels, and other factors, our model contributes to a deeper understanding of soil ecosystems and supports informed decision-making in agriculture and environmental science.
